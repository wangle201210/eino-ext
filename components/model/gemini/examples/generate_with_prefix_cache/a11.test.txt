A series of three dots (...) is used to designate those portions of the communications that could not be transcribed because of garbling. One dash (-) is used to indicate a speaker's pause or a self-interruption and subsequent completion of a thought. Two dashes (- -) are used to indicate an interruption by another speaker or a point at which a recording was terminated abruptly.
